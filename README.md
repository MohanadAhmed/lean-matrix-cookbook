### The Matrix Cookbook, using Lean's mathlib

This repository aims to provide the lemmas in [The Matrix Cookbook](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf) (November 15, 2012) as proofs in the Lean theorem prover.

Ideally, every proof in this repository should be a reference to a single lemma in [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/), the maths library for lean.

Many statements are currently `sorry`d.
