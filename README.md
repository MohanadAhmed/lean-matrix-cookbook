### The Matrix Cookbook, using Lean's mathlib

[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-908a85?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/eric-wieser/lean-matrix-cookbook)

This repository aims to provide the lemmas in [The Matrix Cookbook](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf) (November 15, 2012) as proofs in the Lean theorem prover.

Ideally, every proof in this repository should be a reference to a single lemma in [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/), the maths library for lean.

The progress bar below shows the state of this repository; green represents lemmas which are proven, yellow lemmas which are stated, and red lemmas which are neither.
Clicking on the progress bar will take you to a version that links to each lemma.
